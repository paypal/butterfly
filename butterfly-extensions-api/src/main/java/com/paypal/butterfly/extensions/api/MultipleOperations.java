/**
 * Transformation utility to perform multiple transformation operations. Multiple transformation operations
 * are defined based on an operation template and two other factors, that could be applied
 * exclusively or together. They are:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Multiple files: multiple operations are defined based on multiple files specified as a
 *     list, held as one or more transformation context attribute, and set via {@link #setFiles(String...)}</li>
 *     <li>Multiple configurations: multiple operations are defined based on different configurations,
 *     set via {@link #setProperties(String, String)}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <br>
 * In other words, there are two possible ways to define multiple operations: multiple
 * files, or multiple configurations (different property values). It is also possible
 * to combine both, resulting in multiple operations to be executed against multiple files and
 * with multiple configurations.
 * <br>
 * <strong>Important:</strong> when running against multiple files, any path set to this operation,
 * either relative or absolute, will be ignored, and set later at transformation time based on
 * the dynamically set multiple files. When running with multiple configurations, the properties set
 * during transformation time will override any value that could have been set during definition time
