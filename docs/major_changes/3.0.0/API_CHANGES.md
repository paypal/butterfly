| From | To | Notes |
|---|---|---|
|`com.paypal.butterfly.facade`|`com.paypal.butterfly.api`|Notice API project `butterfly-api` has been created, replacing `butterfly-facade`.|

|`com.paypal.butterfly.facade.ButterflyFacade`|`com.paypal.butterfly.api.ButterflyFacade`|This interface was moved to `butterfly-api` project. Notice also that now every `transform` method returns `com.paypal.butterfly.api.TransformationResult` and don't throw `ButterflyException` anymore (except the ones that take the template class as a `String` parameter).|

### Methods whose signature didn't change, but documented result did

This section list methods that had their signature preserved, in terms of return type and list of parameters, but that might have had their contract changed in terms of documented behavior or exceptions they might throw.

| Method | What changed |
|---|---|
|`com.paypal.butterfly.extensions.api.Extension.getRootPomFile(File)`|Instead of returning `null` it now throws `IOException`, if pom file does not exist, or any error happens when trying to read it. Also it throws `XmlPullParserException` if any error happens when trying to parse the pom file.|

### CLI changes

1. The format for the JSON result file generated by the CLI, if option `-r` is used, has changed. Basically it contains now more information than it used too, including transformation metrics. Read end user documentation for further details.
