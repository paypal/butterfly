# Quick Start

In this document we will install Butterfly, and run it to transform a sample application, a REST service originally following a WAR structure, to be Spring Boot based.

Follow the steps below.

### 1- Installing Butterfly

* Install Butterfly following [this document](https://paypal.github.io/butterfly/Installing-Butterfly).
* Following the same document, install [butterfly-springboot-extension-3.1.0.jar](https://paypal.github.io/butterfly/jar/butterfly-springboot-extension-3.1.0.jar) Butterfly extension, which will be used to transform the sample app.

### 2- The sample application

* Download the sample application from [sample-app.zip](https://paypal.github.io/butterfly/zip/sample-app.zip) and unzip it in a working directory.
* Take a look at the application files. Notice that, as a typical WAR project, it has, for example, a `web.xml` file under a `webapp/WEB-INF` folder.

 ```
 sample-app
 ├── README.md
 ├── pom.xml
 └── src
     └── main
         ├── java
         │   └── com
         │       └── sample
         │           └── app
         │               ├── Echo.java
         │               ├── EchoMessage.java
         │               ├── EchoMessageCreator.java
         │               └── JaxrsApplication.java
         └── webapp
             └── WEB-INF
                 ├── applicationContext.xml
                 └── web.xml
 ```
* Optionally, build, deploy and test it. You can do so by running the command below, deploying the generated `war` file to a Servlet container (like Tomcat for example), and then following the `README.md` file in the app root folder to test it.

 ```
 mvn package
 ```

### 3- Running Butterfly

* Now, finally Butterfly will be used to transform the app. Run the command below.
 
 ```
 butterfly sample-app
 ```
 
* Check if you got an output similar to this:

 ``` 
 No active profile set, falling back to default profiles: default

 Check log file for details: /Users/fabio/dev/butterfly/butterfly/logs/sample-app_20171016175311736.log
 ```

* Notice that Butterfly placed the transformed application in a new folder, with a timestamp as suffix on its name. 

 ```
 Transformed application folder: /Users/fabio/dev/butterfly/butterfly/transformed-apps/sample-app-transformed-20171016175315818
 ```

* Notice also that it differs from the original app, as expected. For example, the whole `webapp` folder has been removed.

 ```
* Open the log file, its location was printed on the console.

 ```

* See a description of all changes that were performed to transform the app.

 ```

### 4- The transformed application

* Optionally, build, run and test the transformed application. You can build and start it very easily by running: 

 ```
 mvn package spring-boot:run
 ```
* To test it, do as you did before (follow its README file), since the app functionality remains the same.

### 5- What is next?

Butterfly has a variaty of very helpful running modes. Read [Running Butterfly](https://paypal.github.io/butterfly/Running-Butterfly) for further information.
