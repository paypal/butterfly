-f                               Transforms the application in the same folder

                                   placed. It defaults to same location where  
                                   original application is. Transformed        
                                   application is placed under a new folder    
                                   whose name is same as original folder, plus 
                                   "-transformed-yyyyMMddHHmmssSSS" suffix     
-r <File: result file>           Creates a result file in JSON format          
                                   containing details, not about the

                                   execution                                   
-s <Integer: template shortcut>  The shortcut number to the transformation     
                                   template to be executed. If both shortcut (-
                                   s) and template class (-t) name are         
                                   supplied, the shortcut will be ignored. If  
                                   the chosen transformation template is an    
                                   upgrade template, then the application will 
                                   be upgraded all the way to the latest       
                                   version possible, unless upgrade version (-

                                   template to be executed. This option has    
                                   precedence over -s. If the chosen           
                                   transformation template is an upgrade       
                                   template, then the application will be      
                                   upgraded all the way to the latest version  
                                   possible, unless upgrade version (-u) is

-u <upgrade version>             The version the application should be upgraded
                                   to. This option only makes sense if the     
                                   transformation template to be used is also  
                                   an upgrade template. If not, it is ignored. 
                                   If it is, but this option is not specified, 
                                   then the application will be upgraded all   
                                   the way to the latest version possible      
-v                               Runs Butterfly in verbose mode, printing log
