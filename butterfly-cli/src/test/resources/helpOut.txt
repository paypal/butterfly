                                   supplied, the shortcut will be ignored. If  
                                   the chosen transformation template is an    
                                   upgrade template, then the application will 
                                   be upgraded all the way to the latest       
                                   version possible, unless upgrade version (- 
                                   u) is specified                             
-t <String: template>            The Java class name of the transformation     
                                   template to be executed. This option has    
                                   precedence over -s. If the chosen           
                                   transformation template is an upgrade       
                                   template, then the application will be      
                                   upgraded all the way to the latest version  
                                   possible, unless upgrade version (-u) is    
                                   specified                                   
-u <String: upgrade version>     The version the application should be upgraded
                                   to. This option only makes sense if the     
                                   transformation template to be used is also  
                                   an upgrade template. If not, it is ignored. 
                                   If it is, but this option is not specified, 
                                   then the application will be upgraded all   
                                   the way to the latest version possible      
-v                               Runs Butterfly in verbose mode, printing log  
                                   messages not just in a log file, but also on
                                   the console                                 
-z                               Outputs a zip file instead of a folder
