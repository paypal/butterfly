Ostara
==============

## What is this?
It's a framework that enables automatic transformation of software projects to adapt to the changes of both the open source and closed source frameworks they use.

Ostara changes the code of the project based on the framework changes. We are building a repository of addons suitable mainly for open source frameworks. Not all frameworks can be open sourced and the Apache license allows closed source addons to suit proprietary frameworks.

## Mission
Make framework upgrades a breeze with high automation, accelerate the rate of framework innovations by making backwards compatibility a minor problem.

## Where did it come from?
This project contains the core functionality of the ebay platform upgrade solution used by it's Java platform.

## Development strategy
1. We are committed to push as much generic non-ebay features into the Ostara code base as it's feasible.
1. We will be developing incubation modules in both ebay and Ostara repositories.
1. Suitable for but not exclusive to Maven and Spring based Java projects. We want to build a developer community to enrich and extend the project with more use cases suitable to all Java developers.
2. Polyglot support is in the works as well as this framework is suitable for most non-Java platforms. We're currently thinking about Scala with Akka and node.js, but those are just some examples.

## Who are the core contributors?
We are a team in ebay's Global Platform Frameworks organization. Our charter is to enable one of the web's most popular place to excel, scale and evolve to new heights.

Our expertise covers the full JVM and Web stacks, massive scale distributed systems, computer language analysis&transformation and beyond.

## Community input
We seek input from developers across the globe to shape the future of this project. We are receptive to ideas, enhancements, features and code contributions.
